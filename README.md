# Greenhouse-for-Mars
We must be able to grow enough fruit and vegetables to feed every martian every day all year round.
Shipping heavy parts from Earth is probably not an option, at least not in the long term, so we can only use Martian raw materials for the construction material, for the grow medium and for fertilizer chemicals.
